# My First React ToDo App

## Outline
This is an incredibly simple ToDo app made in React.

Based on the Medium tutorial:

[https://aidenlsoliver.medium.com/how-to-create-a-simple-todo-list-in-react-ff572e2126c5]


## Content
The first iteration is basically just the input form and display of the list.

There are two buttons to complete and remove the todo items.

## What's next?
- Improve the css
- Add a way to persist the data
- Add sorting (drag and drop)
- Add Projects (grouping of Todo items)
- Add a way to "uncomplete" Todo items
- Add a due date
- Add css to highlight due today, due in the next few days, or overdue.
